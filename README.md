This is a small Python project created for learning and practice purposes.  
The project helps in understanding basic Python concepts, program structure, and how to manage a simple project using Git and GitHub.

The project requires some Python libraries to run properly. These libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and must be installed before executing the project. Using external libraries allows the project to demonstrate real-world Python usage and dependency management.

The repository follows a simple and clean structure so that beginners can easily read, modify, and extend the code.  
Each file in the project has a specific purpose, which improves readability and maintainability.

This project can be used to:
- Practice Python programming
- Learn how to install and use Python libraries
- Understand project structure and file organization
- Learn how to run Python scripts
- Get familiar with GitHub repositories and version control

The project is intentionally kept small and simple, making it ideal for beginners who want to improve their Python skills step by step.
